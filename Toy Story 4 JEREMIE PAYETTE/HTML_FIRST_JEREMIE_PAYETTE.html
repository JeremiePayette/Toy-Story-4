            Woody and the gang go on a road trip with new toy Forky, who's convinced he's trash and doesn't yet
            understand his role in the world. Along the way, Woody is unexpectedly reunited with independent
            spirit Bo Peep and finds himself faced with a decision, and a future, he never imagined.

                He is a vintage cowboy doll that originally belonged to a boy named Andy Davis. As Andy's favorite since kindergarten, Woody
                served as the leader of Andy's toys, a position he upheld by looking out for each member of the group. When Andy enters
                adulthood and leaves for college, Woody is donated to a little girl named Bonnie Anderson. He remains with Bonnie for some time,
                before choosing to become an owner-less antique devoted to helping lost toys find owners, alongside his girlfriend Bo Peep.

                He is a spaceman action figure originally belonging to Andy Davis. Buzz was created during a time where astronauts were especially
                popular amongst children. His arrival in the original Toy Story created conflict with Andy's favorite toy Sheriff Woddy, though
                this rivalry would eventually blossom into a lifelong friendship.

            An actual spork-turned-craft-project, Forky is pretty sure that he doesn't belong in Bonnie's room. Unfortunately, every time he
            tries to get away, Woody yanks him back into an adventure he'd rather skip. Forky is a toy that Bonnie made out of a disposable
            spork, so he's facing a crisis. He wants to fulfill his purpose as a spork, but now has a new toy purpose thrust upon him.

            Bo is the romantic interest (later girlfriend) of Woody, providing a calm and loving comfort whenever he is overwhelmed. She is
            noted for using her shepherdess crook to hook her cowboy and bring him closer in a romantic way. In private, she is a great deal
            more daring with her words and actions, which Woody seems to be quite fond of. She and her sheep were bought along with the lamp
            not too long after Molly was born, due to the baby being scared of the dark, which 'broke every toy's heart', according to Woody.
            The lamp comforted Molly and she would foten have her hand lay on Bo's feet.
